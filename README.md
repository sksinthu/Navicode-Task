# ReactJS Website Based on Design Sample

## Introduction

Welcome to the ReactJS Website project! The goal of this project is to recreate a non-responsive website based on a given design sample. We’re focusing on getting the colors, fonts, and layout just right to match the original design. This is a static project, so no media queries or flexible layouts have been used—it's all about the pixel-perfect match for the specific screen size in the design.
